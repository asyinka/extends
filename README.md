This project reflect the use of INHERITANCE.

it makes a child class inherit all the methods and properties from another defined class with the EXTENDS keyword in use.

This project also contains the use of SUPER keyword in the constructor scenario.
It also contains the use of GETTER.
Take note of the underscore in calling the GET function. The use of "_" renders a value protected and cannot be edited or reassigned without going back to the first declaration.
This project also contains the use of SETTER.
When a value is rendered as read-only or protected, the use of setters helps to edit the value.
